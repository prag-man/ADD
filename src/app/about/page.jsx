            Digital technology has brought about significant changes in our
            lives, both positive and negative. At Anuvrat Vishva Bharati

            individuals who support and encourage each other in their digital
            detox journey. We aim to help individuals strike a balance between
            their use of technology and their daily lives, promoting mindfulness
            and self-care in an increasingly digital world.
