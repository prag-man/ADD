            Digital technology has brought about significant changes in our
            lives, both positive and negative. At Anuvrat Vishva Bharati
            Society, our mission is to create a community of like-minded
            individuals who support and encourage each other in their digital
            detox journey. We aim to help individuals strike a balance between
            their use of technology and their daily lives, promoting mindfulness
            and self-care in an increasingly digital world.
